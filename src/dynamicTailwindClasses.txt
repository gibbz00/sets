/*
    Dynamic tailwind classes are usually not allowed since Tailwind extracts the classes to ship by regexing source code.
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names

    But because of this project's use of Svelte-kit, much of the code for this project is on the hand already pre-build.
    
    The purpose of this file is therefore to act as a dumping place for those classes that are "dynamically" generated on server-side.
    Classes are to be added with RegisterDynamicTailwindClass

    P.S Pointing 'content' of tailwind.config.js to outDir of Svelte-kit didn't really work for me.
     And I assume that even if it did, it wouln't be a good solution in dev mode.
     Such broad pattern matching can hardly be performant.
